The final Escape Room was rotunda-themed, and consisted of six mechatronic elements: the time machine puzzle with decoy buttons, the LED strips along the floor and LED window simulating fire, the candle puzzle using Hall-Effect sensors and a servo controlled chest, the morse code puzzle, the final table puzzle with Hall-Effect sensor triggered gears, and the Amazon Echo Dot for hints along the way. Each puzzle and segment of the escape room communicated with the gear table and the Echo Dot through WiFi chips, enabling the escape room to become an IoT project.  Our goal for this past year was to build off the idea of the escape room and make mini game tables to place around the engineering school, but unfortunately we were not able to finish these projects due to not returning to grounds.Many of our past projects have been along the same line as these. We have completed the Mechatronic Clock that is hanging in the mechanical engineering building and several other smaller projects, as listed below.HooTime - A clock that mechanically writes the time on Boogie Boards.

Participation in the UndocuAlly training consists of one day (6 hour total) of attendance.  This training is designed for students, faculty, administration members, and UVa affiliated members who are committing themselves to actively learn about themselves, others and the experiences and challenges that undocumented students face both locally (on and off-grounds) and nationally.  They willfully have to make an effort to become more knowledgeable about the issues surrounding undocumented students.   Other components of the training include, but are not limited to, continued exploration and awareness of power and privilege, and supporting and advocating of undocumented students.  This organization will make sure the participants understand that the identities and experiences of undocumented students are diverse and not always hinged upon migrant legal status, but sometimes on varying racial-ethnic, sexual, socioeconomic, and gender factors.  This training serves as a learning tool however it goes beyond that, it is designed to encourage advocacy efforts on and off grounds.  It serves to encourage the participants to remain informed about the issues discussed, even after they leave the training.  We push for participants to incorporate undocu+ friendly language and frameworks into their pedagogy and into their programming.   We instill in the participants that revealing the status of others without their permission is harmful.  We motivate participants to become aware of their campus resources that are available to undocu+ people, so as to direct any student towards those support networks when needed. 	We are currently planning undocu+ Week as well which takes place in March.  We have already been approached by two amazing organizations who would like to co-sponsor.  One organization is interested in having a movie night.  Other ideas on the table are Trivia Night about the citizenship process and a Panel Discussion with experts in Immigration law.  Since we are having our undocu+ Week in correlation with DMV undocu orgs we will have a bigger audience, hopefully.

While in the past our official membership was counted at around 22, in recent years, it has increased to an astounding 200 official members. Even more surprising, is that a significant portion of active participants in VSA are not registered members. The remarkable increase in official membership is therefore indicative of the overall development of VSA. VSA is dedicated to sharing the Vietnamese culture with the University community as well as the larger Charlottesville community. VSA has collaborated with the Chinese Student Association and the Korean Student Association to celebrate the Full Moon Festival, as well as the Organization of Young Filipino Americans in a cultural food exchange, and the Taiwanese Student Association for their annual Night Market. VSA participates in Culturefest every year, displaying Vietnamese music, dance and fashion for the University community. A Vietnamese language class has been held previously for speakers or non speakers of all levels. As the first Asian Pacific American CIO on Grounds, VSA pioneered the art of the culture show back in 1983 when a group of Vietnamese students came together to create a production with the aim of celebrating the Lunar New Year. From that first event came VSA annual Tet Show, a celebration of culture, music, food, dance, and fashion that is shared not only with the University and Charlottesville communities, but also with the wider international Vietnamese community, as the event is covered in newspapers and TV around the world. VSA is committed to developing leadership in the APA community. VSA regularly sends its entire officership, consisting of 21 officers to DiAPAson, a leadership training retreat designed to bring together the leaders of various APA organizations. Networking through DiAPAson creates the foundation for future collaborations within the University. VSA also sends a number of members to the Vietnamese American Youth Leadership Conference hosted by the National Congress of Vietnamese Americans. The conference is designed to familiarize attendees with basic leadership skills, grant writing, access to government institutions and other advantageous resources. During the past year, VSA at UVA has taken the lead in the establishment of the Mid Atlantic Union of Vietnamese Student Associations. MAUVSA includes organizations from Virginia, Maryland, DC, Delaware, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. VSA at UVA hosted a summit of leaders in the Harrison Institute where the mission statement for the constitution of MAUVSA was created, in addition to the formation of a number of goals for the burgeoning umbrella organization. Phofest began as an annual event aimed at sharing the Vietnamese culture through food, specifically Vietnam event, first benefiting Madison House flag football team in an annual charity tournament hosted by the VSA at George Mason University. Further efforts to raise awareness about the charity Kids Without Borders has resulted in a total of $10,000 that the VSA at UVA will be donating to Pacific Links Foundation through various fundraising efforts.",200,$10 ,,"SAF, fundraisers, donations",,Neither,Monthly,2,March ,Fall semester,Marketing,Planning Events,Reserving Spaces,Fundraising/Budgeting/Co-Sponsorships,,Recruiting New Members,,Community Building/Icebreakers,Motivating Members,,,"Collaboration (with other CIOs, the community, faculty/staff, etc.)",,"Yes, I am the incoming President.","Yes, this is my first time as President for this organization"

As before, we plan to hold more weightlifting parties, either squat, deadlift, or bench focused. Additionally, we intend on providing seminars from some of the more veteran lifters on nutrition, proper lifting technique, injury clinics, correcting muscle imbalances, proper mobility training, and lifting programming. These events are intended to bring people together as a lifting community and give them additional tools and information to make progress in their personal goals, whatever those may entail. We feel that especially for novice lifters or new members, these seminars and discussions will be an excellent way to provide them with a way to ease into a potentially intimidating environment for newcomers via the support of our community.
